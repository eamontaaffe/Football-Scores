## Project 5: Super Duo
This is a project for Udacity's [Android Developers Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree--nd801).

This project specifically tests the knowleged learnt in the course [Advanced Android App Development](https://www.udacity.com/course/advanced-android-app-development--ud855).

### Starting Code
Here is the [starting code](https://www.udacity.com/api/nodes/4276988636/supplemental_media/football-scores-startingzip/download) for this project.

### Project Description
> #### Project Overview
> You will productionize two apps, taking them from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

> #### Why this Project?

> Super Duo gives you an opportunity to diagnose problems in a pair of apps and also practice improving apps. These skills are vital to building apps users will love.

> Diagnosing issues with existing apps is key to working on large apps or continuing projects in Android. Being aware of the common pitfalls in app design frees a developer to produce novel app experiences without making the same mistakes over and over.

> #### What Will I Learn?

> In this project, you will:

> - Diagnose existing issues with an app.
> - Make an app accessible to sight-impaired users.
> - Allow your app to be localized for distribution in other countries.
> - Handle error cases in Android.
> - Add a widget to your app experience.
> - Leverage the functionality of a library in your app.


### UI Review Node

> Lyla says:
> “This app is starting to shape up but it feels a bit off in quite a few places. I can't put finger on it but it feels odd.”

> Jay says:
> “Is the text supposed to be so wonky and unreadable? It is not accessible to those of us without perfect vision."

> Kagure says:
> “The color scheme is really sad and I shouldn't feel sad.”
